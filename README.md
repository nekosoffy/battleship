# Battleship Game

:arrow_forward:  **[Live preview!](https://nekosoffy.github.io/battleship/)**

Implementation of a classic strategy game where players take turns guessing the locations of their opponent's ships on a 10x10 grid. The game is designed to be played against a computer AI, offering an engaging challenge for the player. The theme of this implementation is shifted from ships to aircrafts, in a battle of humans against aliens.

The player can drag and drop the fleets on the grid in the manner that they desire, strategically placing them in order to avoid being hit. They can also automatically add all of the fleets randomly. The computer opponent uses an elaborate algorithm to select targets based on previous hits and misses. Gameplay alternates between the players until one of them have all of its fleets destroyed, with real-time announcements giving updates on hits, misses, and the game's conclusion.
